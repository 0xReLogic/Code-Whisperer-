# Machine Learning Approach for Code Whisperer

## Overview

Code Whisperer uses a hybrid machine learning approach combining statistical methods, pattern recognition algorithms, and user behavior analysis to provide intelligent code suggestions.

## Core Learning Objectives

### 1. Pattern Recognition
- **Input**: User's codebase, coding history, and style preferences
- **Output**: Detected coding patterns with confidence scores
- **Goal**: Identify recurring patterns in user's coding habits

### 2. User Behavior Learning
- **Input**: User interactions with suggestions (accept/reject/modify)
- **Output**: Updated pattern weights and user preferences
- **Goal**: Adapt suggestions based on user feedback

### 3. Contextual Understanding
- **Input**: Current coding context, project structure, language
- **Output**: Contextually relevant suggestions
- **Goal**: Provide suggestions that fit the current coding situation
